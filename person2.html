            Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical
            physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for
            Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[17][18][7] Between 1979 and 2009 he was the Lucasian
            Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

            Hawking was born in Oxford, into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his
            university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In
            October 1962 he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966 he obtained his PhD
            degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In
            1963 Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic
            lateral sclerosis – ALS, for short) that gradually, over the decades, paralysed him.[19][20] After the loss
            of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld
            switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[21]

            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems
            in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation,
            often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and
            following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in
            theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the
            general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds
            interpretation of quantum mechanics.[22][23]

            Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories
            and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for
            a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical
            Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the
            United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died
            on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.

                <b>Family</b>
            <p> Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[24][25] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née
                Walker).[26][27] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.[28][29] His
                wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went
                bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.[29] His paternal
                great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.[29] Despite
                their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read
                medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[27] Isobel worked as a secretary for a
                medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.[27][30] Hawking had two younger sisters,
                Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).[31]

                In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for
                Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.[32][33] In St Albans, the family was
                considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;[32][34] meals were often spent with each person
                silently reading a book.[32] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained
                house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.[35][36] During one of Hawking's father's frequent
                absences working in Africa,[37] the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his
                mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.[38]
            </p>
            <b>Primary and secondary school years</b>

            <p>Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. He later blamed its
                "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[39][32] In St Albans, the
                eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger
                boys could attend one of the houses.[38][40]

                Hawking attended two independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School[40] and from September
                1952, St Albans School,[25][41] after passing the eleven-plus a year early.[42] The family placed a high
                value on education.[32] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School,
                but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not
                afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St
                Albans.[43][44] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom
                he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[45] and long
                discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.[46] From 1958 on, with the help of the
                mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard
                and other recycled components.[47][48]

                Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.[49] With
                time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to
                read mathematics at university.[50][51][52] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned
                that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.[53] He also wanted his son to attend University
                College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time,
                Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next
                year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.[54][55]
            </p>
            <b>Undergraduate years</b>

            <p>Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford,[25] in October 1959 at the age of
                17.[56] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely – he found the academic work
                "ridiculously easy".[57][58] His physics-tutor, Robert Berman, later said, "It was only necessary for
                him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did
                it."[3] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more
                of an effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college-member,
                interested in classical music and science-fiction.[56] Part of the transformation resulted from his
                decision to join the college boat-club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a
                rowing-crew.[59][60] The rowing-coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image,
                steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.[59][61] Hawking estimated that he studied
                about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his
                finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those
                requiring factual knowledge. A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate
                study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[62][63] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the
                examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making
                a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.[63][64]

                Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the viva to
                describe his plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I
                shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."[63][65] He was held in higher regard than
                he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to
                someone far cleverer than most of themselves".[63] After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics
                and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in
                October 1962.[25][66][67]
            </p>

            <b>Postgraduate years</b>

            <p> Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he
                had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather
                than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle,[68][69] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for
                work in general relativity and cosmology.[70] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking
                fell into a depression – though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was
                little point.[71] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had
                difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he
                had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his
                work.[72][73] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly
                challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.[74][75]

                When Hawking began his doctoral studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the
                prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories.[76]
                Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking
                applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this
                topic.[77][78] Hawking's thesis[79] was approved in 1966.[79] There were other positive developments:
                Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge;[80] he obtained his
                PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and
                cosmology, in March 1966;[81] and his essay "Singularities and the Geometry of Space–Time" shared top
                honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.[82][81]

            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>
                Hawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76.[305][306][307] His family
                stated that he "died peacefully".[308][309] He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment,
                politics, and other areas.[310][311][312][313] The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and
                a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors.[314][315][316] A tribute was made to Hawking
                in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic
                Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.[317]

                His private funeral took place on 31 March 2018,[318] at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge.[318][319]
                Guests at the funeral included The Theory of Everything actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, Queen
                guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, and model Lily Cole.[320][321] In addition, actor Benedict
                Cumberbatch, who played Stephen Hawking in Hawking, astronaut Tim Peake, Astronomer Royal Martin Rees
                and physicist Kip Thorne provided readings at the service.[322] Although Hawking was an atheist, the
                funeral took place with a traditional Anglican service.[323][324] Following the cremation, a service of
                thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey on 15 June 2018, after which his ashes were interred in the
                Abbey's nave, between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.[1][320][325][326]

                Inscribed on his memorial stone are the words "Here lies what was mortal of Stephen Hawking 1942–2018"
                and his most famed equation.[327] He directed, at least fifteen years before his death, that the
                Bekenstein–Hawking entropy equation be his epitaph.[328][329][note 1] In June 2018, it was announced
                that Hawking's words, set to music by Greek composer Vangelis, would be beamed into space from a
                European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, 1A
                0620-00.[334]

                Hawking's final broadcast interview, about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the
                collision of two neutron stars, occurred in October 2017.[335] His final words to the world appeared
                posthumously, in April 2018, in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel documentary entitled, Leaving
                Earth: Or How to Colonize a Planet.[336][337] One of his final research studies, entitled A smooth exit
                from eternal inflation?, about the origin of the universe, was published in the Journal of High Energy
                Physics in May 2018.[338][339][340][341] Later, in October 2018, another of his final research studies,
                entitled Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair,[342] was published, and dealt with the "mystery of what
                happens to the information held by objects once they disappear into a black hole".[343][344] Also in
                October 2018, Hawking's last book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, a popular science book presenting
                his final comments on the most important questions facing humankind, was published.[345][346][347]

                On 8 November 2018, an auction of 22 personal possessions of Stephen Hawking, including his doctoral
                thesis ("Properties of Expanding Universes", PhD thesis, Cambridge University, 1965) and wheelchair,
                took place, and fetched about £1.8 m.[348][349] Proceeds from the auction sale of the wheelchair went to
                two charities, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation;[350] proceeds
                from Hawking's other items went to his estate.[349]

                In March 2019, it was announced that the Royal Mint issued a commemorative 50 pence coin in honour of
                Hawking.[351] The same month, Hawking's nurse, Patricia Dowdy, was struck off for "failures over his
                care and financial misconduct."[352]
