            Albert Einstein; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[5] widely
            acknowledged to be one of the
            greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also
            made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum
            mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][6] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
            which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[7] His work is also
            known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
            effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and
            originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".[11]

            In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four
            groundbreaking papers.[12] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion,
            introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of
            classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to
            develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published
            a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the
            general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[13][14] He continued to deal with
            problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and
            the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of
            radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.

            However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors.
            First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that
            nature "does not play dice".[15] Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his
            geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
            from the mainstream of modern physics.

            Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship
            (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he
            enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in
            Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life,
            and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a
            PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of
            Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm
            Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.

            In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, of
            Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government;[16] he settled in the United
            States and became an American citizen in 1940.[17] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to
            President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and
            recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the
            idea of nuclear weapons.

                <b>Family</b>
            <p> Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[24][25] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née
                Walker).[26][27] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.[28][29] His
                wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went
                bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.[29] His paternal
                great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.[29] Despite
                their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read
                medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[27] Isobel worked as a secretary for a
                medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.[27][30] Hawking had two younger sisters,
                Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).[31]

                In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for
                Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.[32][33] In St Albans, the family was
                considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;[32][34] meals were often spent with each person
                silently reading a book.[32] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained
                house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.[35][36] During one of Hawking's father's frequent
                absences working in Africa,[37] the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his
                mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.[38]
            </p>
            <b>Early life and education</b>

            <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879
                into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.[18][19] His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and
                engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle
                Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical
                equipment based on direct current.[5]

                Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the
                age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium),
                where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven
                years later.[20]

                In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting
                because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the
                more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.[21] The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In
                search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia.
                When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the
                Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed
                with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the
                spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894,
                he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a
                doctor's note.[22] During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation
                of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".[23][24]

                Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his
                peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.[25]
                Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12.[26]
                A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook,
                after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher
                mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."[27] His
                passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood
                as a "mathematical structure".[27] Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a
                14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".[28]

                At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music),[29] Einstein was
                introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating:
                "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to
                ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."[27]

                Einstein's matriculation certificate at the age of 17. The heading translates as "The Education
                Committee of the Canton of Aargau". His scores were German 5, French 3, Italian 5, History 6, Geography
                4, Algebra 6, Geometry 6, Descriptive Geometry 6, Physics 6, Chemistry 5, Natural History 5, Art Drawing
                4, Technical Drawing 4. 6 = very good, 5 = good, 4 = sufficient, 3 = insufficient, 2 = poor, 1 = very
                poor.
                Einstein's Matura certificate, 1896[note 2]
                In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic
                school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required
                standard in the general part of the examination,[30] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and
                mathematics.[31] On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian
                cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.
                While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter,
                Marie. Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.[32] In January 1896, with his father's
                approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military
                service.[33] In September 1896 he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade
                of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.[34] At 17, he enrolled in the four-year
                mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who
                was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.[32]

                Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic
                school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section
                of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein's and Marić's friendship developed
                into a romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra-curricular
                physics in which they were both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he preferred
                studying alongside her.[35] In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a
                Federal teaching diploma.[36] There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that
                indicate Marić might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his landmark 1905 papers,[35][37][38]
                known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their
                studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any
                substantive contributions.[39][40][41][42]
            </p>
            <b>First scientific papers</b>

            <p>In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the
                Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik.[74][75] On 30 April 1905,
                Einstein completed his thesis,[76] with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as
                pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his
                dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.[76][77]

                Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four
                groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the
                equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age
                of 26.
            </p>

            <b>Academic career</b>

            <p> By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.
                The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the
                University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in
                theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.[78]

                Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911,
                accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.[79][80] During his Prague stay,
                he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.
                In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of
                theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also
                studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he
                worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.[81]

                When the "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of
                prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World
                War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic
                "Manifesto to the Europeans".[82]


                The New York Times reported confirmation of "the Einstein theory" (specifically, the bending of light by
                gravitation) based on 29 May 1919 eclipse observations in Principe (Africa) and Sobral (Brazil), after
                the findings were presented on 6 November 1919 to a joint meeting in London of the Royal Society and the
                Royal Astronomical Society.[83] (Full text)
                On 3 July 1913, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther
                Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering
                him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be
                established.[84] Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching
                duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he
                moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect
                of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. He joined the academy and
                thus Berlin University[85] on 1 April 1914.[clarification needed][86] As World War I broke out that
                year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1
                October 1917, with Einstein as its director.[87] In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German
                Physical Society (1916–1918).[88]

                Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from
                another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur
                Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the
                international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The
                Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe –
                Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".[89]

                In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[90] In 1922,
                he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially
                for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".[10] While the general theory of relativity
                was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited
                photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was
                considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck
                spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in
                1921.[3] He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.[3]

            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>
                On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic
                aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[185] He took the
                draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's
                seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.[186]

                Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life
                artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."[187] He died in Penn
                Medicine Princeton Medical Center early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work
                until near the end.[188]

                During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation
                without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to
                discover what made Einstein so intelligent.[189] Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New
                Jersey,[190] and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.[191][192]

                In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert
                Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without
                sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once
                childlike and profoundly stubborn."[193]

                Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of
                Jerusalem in Israel.[194]
